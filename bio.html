		<h1>Evan's Bio</h1>

		<p>Hello my name is Evan and welcome to my bio page!</p>
		<br />
		<p></p>
		<h2>About Me</h2>
		I'm a 38 year old man who most of his life lived in Los Angeles. Currently
		I'm working for gothic clothing company named Killstar located in the city
		of Commerce. My job description is a warehouse specialist.

		<br />
		<h2>My Goal in life</h2>
		<p>
			My goal in life is to continuously improve my myself. In one area that I'm
			trying to improve is learning new skills so I can break into the tech
			field. One of my reasons that I"m trying to get into the tech field is its
			stability. Hopefully by taking courses at Beach Coders it will bring me
			closer to my goal.
